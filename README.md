# PUC-Lua-VS2017
Visual Studio 2017 Project and Installer for PUC Lua

This is a VS 2017 Solution that builds the current version (5.3.4) of Lua from [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br/english/) and includes LuaFileSystem from the [Kepler project](http://www.keplerproject.org). The Solution includes a WIX Toolset installer for generating a Windows MSI installer.

If you are looking for the latest version of Lua to run on Windows 10, download a PUC-Lua-Installer.msi file from Visual/Studio/bin/x86/Release and enjoy.

The only intellectual property of mine is the installer. It's FreeBSD licensed.
